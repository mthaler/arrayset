# arrayset

A port of the array based set from [abc](https://github.com/rklaehn/abc) to Kotlin.

## Motivation

The main goal for this port was to play with the [JMH gradle plugin](https://github.com/melix/jmh-gradle-plugin) and to learn how to implement custom Kotlin collections.
Thus, the code is mostly educational.

This [blog post](http://rklaehn.github.io/2015/12/18/array-based-immutable-collections/) explains the motivation and performance characteristics of the original Scala array based collections.

## Benchmarks

The benchmarks compare creation, membership test, and bulk operations for ArraySet, kotlin.collection.HashSet and java.util.TreeSet.

### Building

TODO

### Set/element operations

The essential operations are membership tests: is the given element contained / not contained in the set?

The performance of the ArraySet is comparable to java.util.TreeSet. This makes sence because lookup for contains is done using a binary search and is therefore O(log n).
Finding an element in a tree set is also O(log n). Unsurprisingly, membership tests of a hash set is much faster. If hash code collisions are rare, the performance of HashSet.contains is O(1).

### Set/set operations

For all major set/set operations ArraySet is faster than HashSet and TreeSet, often considerably. Note the log scale on both the x- and the y-axis.

## Credits

This is straight-forward port of the array based set from [abc](https://github.com/rklaehn/abc) from [RÃ¼diger Klaehn](https://github.com/rklaehn) for educational purpose. It is only a simplified subset of the original code and it also lacks the extensive tests of the original code.
